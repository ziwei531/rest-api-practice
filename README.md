# Rest API Practice with MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express
In this repository, I have taken upon myself to self-study regarding Rest APIs. 

Created the Schema for the REST API. For the purpose of this self-study, I am creating a subscriber schema that has the variables of subscriberName, subscribedToChannel (who they subscribed to), and subscribedDate (the date they subscribed the channel).

Wrote the code for performing the reading, writing, deleting, and updating of new data to the database.

Experimented and wrote the route codes for creating, deleting, updating, and the getting of the data.

All related changes and additions are properly reflected in the database through the route.rest's code.
